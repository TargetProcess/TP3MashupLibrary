# Colorful Theme

This mashup creates a colorized theme with higher cognition of elements such as cards, tags, and more.

Once you install the mashup, it will automatically activate whenever you open TargetProcess. You can toggle the theme using the `COLORFUL` link at the top of the page.

To disable auto-apply, comment the last line in the mashup script ```initColorfulTheme();```.
